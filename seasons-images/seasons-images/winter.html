    <h3>Winter</h3>
<p>Winter is the coldest season of the year so you have to get creative when looking to have fun. Most of the time you will be stuck in side or at least bundled up when you are out. Fighting off the cold does not mean you have to be lame! You can find many ways to enjoy yourself in the snow.
