		<p>In all honesty I chose this website because it is the most used by Jeff in class. I also am familiar with this website because I love sports and I visit it regularly to see what the news is in the sports world. I like this website because it fits a lot of information on the screen. The navigation band at the top is easy to use and can get you any where you want to go in the website. What I most like is that valid information that it can fit into the first page. On both the computer and the phone all the up to date scores and play by plays are easily found. With two columns on the side as well there is a lot of space to fit in more important things. I am also a little bias because I like sports so its just normal that I like this sports page. When I check out the code it all matches up, everything is clean and looking the way it should. I’m no expert but to my untrained eye it looks like all the tables are all where they should be. As I continue to scroll down the columns on the left and the right end and it is just one strip down the middle of videos and sports updates. To me the layout makes sense because it is just stacked on top of each other and the further down you go the narrower your information intake gets. Also, when navigating though other tabs and sub columns all the information and pictures are laid out in a way that is easy for me to follow. The color scheme is quite simple, nothing too bright or anything that jumps off the page. Mostly putting the emphasis on the teams it shows. For me this is perfect, it puts the focus on the news they are presenting rather than on the website itself. Another thing I noticed is that on the drop-down menus it has the icons of each team next to the name. This would be quite helpful for someone who didn’t know the material as well as others and it adds color. </p>

		<p>Apple’s website is different from the last ESPN website that I checked out. What stands out to me the most is the simplistic design and layout of the website. On the home screen there is lots of open space which makes you focus all your attention on one thing. In this case that happens to be the new iPad Pro they are trying to sell. And although it is very different from that last one in what they are going for, I still really like the layout and how the information is presented. The top navigation bar is easy to use and can get you to more info of anything you need. The images are all big, and again with very little action around it so it puts your focus on the product. That is another thing that is different about ESPN and Apple. ESPN was all about pushing information and being up to date with what was going on. This website is much more focused on pushing a product. From phones to computers, each tab or navigation leads you to something more you can waste your money on. Another thing I like about this website is that it looks good on a phone too. Everything fits to size on the phone and its still easy to navigate and find what you’re looking for. The color scheme for Apple is similar to its layout, simple. Lots of white with bright colors on the products to again emphasize what they are selling. One of the little things that stood out to me was how on some navigation tabs they would invert the colors and use mostly black, this for me kept things fresh and broke the pattern. Overall this was a very good website and made me want to upgrade all my apple products. </p>

		<p>Yale University School of Art has a website that is absolutely atrocious. To find it I looked up top 50 worst websites and this was on the top of the list, and for good reason. I do not like this website at all, it is very hard to follow. Right of the bat it comes of way too strong with too many different colors that are bright and hard to follow. There is lots of blue and orange and sharp yellow, and none of it really works well together. The code is quite simple and looks like I could have done it, and that’s saying something. The navigation is bland and it is just as atrocious as the home page. Each navigation tab has its own problems with moving parts and over use of color. It is not very helpful and the words are hard to read because they are very small and in a weird font. Being from Yale I would have thought that is would have been done better, and who knows. Maybe it was just a big joke or contest to see who could make the ugliest website. But for me this website is terrible, also it does not work on the phone. Everything is distorted and out of place. I’d give it a 2 on my scale. </p>
