	<h1> <a href="http://alaska.gov"> 1.Alaska </a></h1>
	<p>The colors of this website pop off and please my eyes. The colores remind me of one of my favorite football teams. The website loads very fast and the menu is quite easy to navigate. I liked the drop down features of the menu, makes all of the features easy to access. I was able to find everything that I was looking for while using the website. This is my favorite website because it is attractive and easy to use. If I were to chose one website to use all the time it would be this one. </p>
	
	<h1><a href="http://tn.gov"> 1.Tennessee </a></h1>
	<p>Tennesee has a vibent and welcoming front page. I like how there are lots of pictures of familys and happy people. Again this website loaded fast and I was able to fiew it on all platforms. The menu is easy to navigate and I was able to find everything I was looking for. The block format made it easy to navigate between tabs. </p>
	
	<h1><a href="http://iowa.gov"> 1.Iowa </a></h1>
	<p>This one had a little harder time adgusting to the size of my screen which made it harder to view the website. But other than that I liked the presentation of the website. The colors were clean and professional and lead me to the different options that it had to offer. As far as navigation gos, I was able to find most of what I was looking for. It was a little different structure than the others but after getting used to it I was able to navigate cleanly.</p>
	
	<h1><a href="http://vermont.gov"> 1.Vermont </a></h1>
	<p>Visially this website was my favorite. The colors on the front page made me want to know more about the state. There are lots of pictres of the state that adds flavor but it also keeps a professional tone. All the tabs were layed out in an easy to find manner and took me to where I wanted to go fast. I liked how easy it was to find what I was looking for. I also like that the information was short and to the point. </p>

	<h1><a href="http://ok.gov"> 1.Oklahoma </a></h1>
	<p>This website was good in the sense that it loaded fast and was good with manuvering. But as far as appearence of the website this was my least favorite. I thought it was a little drab and it didnt catch my attention. It was fast but mauvering was difficult and I wasnt able to find everything that I found on other webistes. Overall it was not the best website I visited, but it did have some strong points. </p>
