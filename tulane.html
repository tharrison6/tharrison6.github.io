			<h1>Tulane Green Wave</h1>
			<h3> Tulane is one of the smallest schools to make the drip list. But they make up for being small in the multiple helmets and uniforms that are all very nice. The Tulane Green Wave football team represents Tulane University in the sport of American football. The Green Wave compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) as a member of the American Athletic Conference (The American). The football team is coached by Willie Fritz, and plays its home games in Yulman Stadium on its campus in Uptown New Orleans. Tulane has played in 13 official bowl games, with the Green Wave garnering a record of 6–7. Tulane also played in the Bacardi Bowl in 1909, playing the Havana Athletic Club, losing 11–0. This was not sanctioned by the NCAA, and thus the Green Wave do not recognize the bowl appearance. Notably, Tulane's first bowl win was the inaugural Sugar Bowl, played in their home stadium.</h3>
